Student Score Prediction Project

This project uses machine learning (Linear Regression) to predict student exam scores based on a variety of academic and personal factors. The goal is to demonstrate how predictive modeling can help identify patterns in student performance and estimate outcomes.

Project Overview

Predicts student exam scores using historical data.

Analyses the impact of different features such as study hours, attendance, and other factors on performance.

Visualizes trends and relationships in the dataset for better understanding.

Provides performance metrics like RÂ² to evaluate the accuracy of the model.

Key Features

Simple and interpretable Linear Regression model.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Easy-to-run Python script for predictions.

Flexible to extend with more advanced models in the future.

Tools & Libraries
